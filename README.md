# ABRP for AutoPi

Thanks for checking out our API code for AutoPi! You can find the installation instructions in the app by selecting one of the following compatible cars and then selecting "Add my Car":
 1. Chevy Bolt EV (all years)
 2. Hyundai Kona (all models)  

Setup instructions coming soon in the app.  For now, you need to set the token and car_model as kwargs in the job.

If you'd like to add another car, the code is open source, feel free to modify the code and submit a pull request.  If you have questions on how to do this contact us at contact@abetterrouteplanner.com

This code is published under the open Apache license, however the app sourcecode itself is not open.

Thank you so much for helping out!
